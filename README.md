## About Me

Hello there! I'm Lukas, a Master's student at the University of British Columbia with a deep-seated curiosity for a myriad of subjects. My academic and professional pursuits span remote sensing, computer vision, game development, GIS, and integrating IoT into environmental sciences. When not engaged in my studies or coding, you can find me backpacking through nature, exploring the vast world of music, or on a quest for new knowledge.

# Academic Focus

I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Forestry, specializing in the health / vigour of sugar maples (_Acer saccharum_). My research uses intracanopy drone videography and photogrammetry to study these majestic trees.
